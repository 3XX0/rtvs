Raspberry pi specificities
==========================

The Raspberry pi contains a Broadcom videocore IV GPU supporting OpenMAX and H264 hardware encoding.
The MMAL API is a Broadcom specific API used on videocore IV to abstract OpenMAX.
4 Components are available under OpenMAX/MMAL: camera, preview, encoder and null_sink.

The preview component is optional, but can be used full screen or directed to a specific rectangular area on the display.
If preview is disabled, the null_sink component is used to 'absorb' the preview frames.
It is necessary for the camera to produce preview frames as they are used for calculating exposure and white balance settings.
